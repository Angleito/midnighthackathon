# 🌊 ZK Ocean Combat

## Project Overview
ZK Ocean Combat is a revolutionary hackathon project that brings **truly fair** turn-based combat to the blockchain using Midnight's zero-knowledge technology. Players engage in ocean-themed combat where monster stats, equipment bonuses, and damage calculations remain completely private until combat ends - making cheating impossible while preserving the excitement of battle.

## 🚀 Hackathon Achievement
This project successfully demonstrates the full power of **Midnight blockchain** and **Compact language** for creating cheat-proof gaming experiences using zero-knowledge proofs on testnet.

## ✨ Core ZK Features
- **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** All combat actions verified on-chain without revealing private data
- **🎭 Hidden Information:** Monster stats remain secret until combat completion
- **⚔️ Private Damage Calculation:** Damage computed with ZK proofs, only results visible
- **🛡️ Equipment Privacy:** Player equipment bonuses hidden from opponents
- **🎲 Blockchain Randomness:** All RNG uses block hashes - no manipulation possible
- **🚫 Anti-Cheat System:** Comprehensive validation prevents all known exploits
- **⏱️ Rate Limiting:** Prevents spam attacks and rapid-fire exploits
- **📊 Commitment-Reveal:** Actions committed before execution to prevent front-running

## 🎮 How It Works

### Zero-Knowledge Combat Flow
1. **Player Action Commitment:** Player commits to an action using ZK proof (attack/magic/defend/flee)
2. **Hidden Calculation:** Damage computed on-chain using private stats + block randomness
3. **Result Revelation:** Only damage numbers revealed, keeping all stats private
4. **Cheat Prevention:** Every action validated with cryptographic proofs

### Monster Privacy System
- Monster health remains **completely hidden** until combat ends
- Only attack/defense values visible to maintain strategy
- True monster strength revealed only upon victory/defeat
- Prevents players from calculating optimal strategies mid-combat

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 24+** 
- **Midnight Wallet** (for testnet)

## 🏆 Demo Instructions

### For Judges/Evaluators
1. **Run Tests:** `npx tsx scripts/test-core-features.ts` - See all ZK features working
2. **Inspect Contracts:** Check `src/contracts/` for Compact smart contract code  
3. **Review Privacy:** See `src/services/privacyService.ts` for hidden information handling
4. **Test Anti-Cheat:** Examine `src/services/cheatPreventionService.ts` for security

### Live Demo Features
- 🎮 **Start Combat:** Watch monster stats privacy in action
- 🔒 **ZK Proof Generation:** See proofs created for each action
- 🎯 **Damage Calculation:** Observe private computation results
- 🛡️ **Cheat Attempts:** Try invalid stats to see prevention system
- 📊 **Block Randomness:** Experience unpredictable combat outcomes

## 📚 Implementation Notes

### ZK Design Patterns Used
- **Private State Machines:** Monster health hidden using ZK state
- **Commitment Schemes:** Actions committed before revelation  
- **Range Proofs:** Validating stats within allowed bounds
- **Merkle Trees:** Equipment verification without disclosure
- **Nullifiers:** Preventing double-spending of actions

### Security Considerations
- All randomness sourced from blockchain (block hashes)
- Rate limiting prevents rapid-fire attacks
- Comprehensive input validation on all user data
- ZK proofs required for every state transition
- Timestamp verification prevents replay attacks

## 🌟 Future Extensions
- **Multiplayer PvP:** Player vs player with hidden stats
- **Equipment Crafting:** Private recipe combinations
- **Guild Systems:** Hidden member contributions  
- **Tournament Brackets:** Anonymous skill-based matching
- **NFT Integration:** Private metadata for rare items
